# BPM-PROJECT


Objective: Follow the BPM lifecycle approach: 
1. Clearly identify the process. Show, why it is a process. 
2. Describe the process. 
3. Model the AS-IS business process, i.e., design a detailed BPMN process model reflecting the current state of the process. This BPMN model should not only deal with the “normal course” of action, but also show how different types of errors/ exceptions are handled.
4. Analyse the AS-IS process using qualitative and quantitative techniques. Identify the issues/problems with the process, like non-value adding steps, wastes, bottlenecks, what-if analysis, scenarios based on simulations, etc. Register the issues and possible solutions in a  suitable way. 
5. Propose the TO-BE process model, identifying its advantages/disadvantages. Eventually you may specify what other alternatives/scenarios were possibly considered (COULD-BE processes)
